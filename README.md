# Music-Equalizer
### Music Player <br />
A desktop application created by PyQT. Can be used as a Music Player. In addition, can do signal processing on songs to supress certain musical instruments or emphasize certain instruments 

### Fourier Transform <br />
The processing is based on Fourier transform, the song is projected to Frequency domain and processed there. Where we can remove any instrument we want by supressing its frequncy. Them, inverse Fourier is done and the song is projected back to spatial domain to be played

### Virtual Instruments <br />
There is some built-in virtual musical instruments which you can play with and generate notes. The buttons of the virtual instruments is mapped to its real frequency. So, it will generate the real sound of the instrument.
